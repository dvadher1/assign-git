• What does fast-forward in git mean?
When we create a branch from master, then do required changes and merge it into the master branch again, it is called fast-forward in git. Because the commit pointer of master branch just need to be moved forward once.

• Why should you have different branches?
Having different branches allows multiple developers to work on the same software. They can be working on different features and different bugs, and yet they can merge their changes into the main branch after testing easily.

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
Every user story should have different branches. Also subtasks and bugs might require a new branch. In any case, there should be at least two branches, master remote repository and dev remote repository.
